## Raw files for Functional Flows Calculator

Data in this folder is formatted to feed directly into the Functional Flows Calculator for analysis. The folder includes data for 223 flow gage sites, split among 4 data files. Each site's data is structured with two columns: the first column lists dates in mm/dd/yyyy format, and has the header "result_dt". The next column to the right contains the corresponding average daily flow in units of cubic feet per second (cfs). The header for the flow column is the station's USGS gage ID, which can be referenced on the USGS website, waterdata.usgs.gov. The files contain full periods of record, including both impaired and unimpaired portions of the flow record. For reference condition data only, please see the "CA_timeseries_reference_only" folder in this repository.
