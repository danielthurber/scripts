## Functional Flows Calculator reference data
The data file in this folder contains all reference-condition daily flow data for California, that is used on the eFlows website. The file contains 223 sites total. Each site's data is structured with two columns: the first column lists dates in mm/dd/yyyy format, and has the header "result_dt". The next column to the right contains the corresponding average daily flow in units of cubic feet per second (cfs). The header for the flow column is the station's USGS gage ID, which can be referenced on the USGS website, waterdata.usgs.gov. In most cases the reference condition flow data in this file represents only a portion of the entire available period of record a site (which often includes flow data that is not reference condition).
